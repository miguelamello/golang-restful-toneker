### TOKENER - UNIFIED TOKEN GENERATOR

This microservice aims to generate tokens for the clients, so they can use the token to access any microservice on the company network. It is a simple service that generates a token and stores it in a unified database. This microservice aims to solve the problem of generating tokens in disparate environments, where each microservice has its own token generator which leads to hardening application ochestration. 

## Tech Stack

- Golang
- MongoDB
- Redis
- GORM
- CentOS

**Golang** is a programming language created by Google. It is a statically-typed language with syntax loosely derived from that of C, adding garbage collection, type safety, some dynamic-typing capabilities, additional built-in types such as variable-length arrays and key-value maps, and a large standard library.I chose Golang for that project because it is a fast, reliable, typed and compiled language and so it is perfect for microservices. 

**MongoDB** is a cross-platform document-oriented database server. Classified as a NoSQL database server, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas. I chose MongoDB because it is a document-oriented database, very fast, scalable and so it is perfect for microservices. MongoDB is used for permanent storage of the tokens.

**Redis** is an in-memory data structure store, used as a distributed, in-memory keyâ€“value database, cache and message broker, with optional durability. I chose Redis because it is a very fast in-memory database, perfect for caching and so it is perfect for microservices. Redis is used for caching the tokens and other service data. Persistence is done to the MongoDB database by a background worker.

**GORM** is a Golang ORM library developed on top of database/sql. I chose GORM because it is a very powerful ORM library, easy to use and so it is perfect for microservices. GORM is used for Mongo database operations. ORM makes database operations better integrated with the code.

**CentOS** is a Linux distribution that provides a free, community-supported computing platform functionally compatible with its upstream source, Red Hat Enterprise Linux. I chose CentOS because it is a very stable Linux distribution, perfect for production environments and so it is perfect for microservices.

## How it works

Please take a look at the OpenAPI specification file `openapi.yaml` for more details. A fully working instance of the service is available at [http://tokener.orionsoft.site/](http://tokener.orionsoft.site/).

For now the exposes the following routes:

- `GET /` - Returns the API presentation

- `GET /reference` - Returns the API reference

- `POST /token` - Generates a new token and stores it in the database. The token is valid for 24 hours. The token is returned in the response body.
